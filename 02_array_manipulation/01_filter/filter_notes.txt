You can use the filter() method to remove items from an array. 

Filter doesn't affect the original array. Instead, it returns a new array. In this case, a new array will be returned containing the items you DO NOT want removed.

Use filter by passing a callback function into the filter() method. The callback is simply a function that should return either true or false:

let array = ['A', 'B', 'C'];

array.filter((item, index) => {
  return letter !== 'B';
})

Result:
['A', 'C']
